# typescript-for-beginners
A tutorial for beginners dedicated to learning TypeScript.

Created for School of Code's week 11 Tutorial Hackathon.

I chose to create a cheatsheet guide that covers the benefits of using TypeScript, how to set up your environment, the core concepts and how to compile and run TypeScript as they were the main questions I had when I began to study it. Having it in one clear and concise cheatsheet would've helped me when I first started to learn.
